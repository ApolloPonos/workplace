## 99 Java Problems

## 

These problems are intended to be a graduated series of exercises to help students gain proficiency at Java programming.

They are a loose copy of the Ninety-Nine Lisp Problems, which are themselves translations of Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems.

I’ve removed some of the less relevant problems and added some simpler ones suitable for new programmers. The problems are designed to get harder as you go through each section. Sometimes the earlier problems will help you solve the later problems.

Make sure that you read the first section: How to Answer These Questions.
